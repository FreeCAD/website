👋 Hello! Welcome to the Trigo Theme documentation!

## What is the Trigo Theme?

Trigo is a simple, modern, fast, feature-packed and flexible [Hugo][hugo] theme to build static websites for documentation, blogs, portfolios and many more.

Hugo is a one of the most popular static site generator. What sets Hugo apart is that it is a single binary, making it easy to install and run on various platforms. It is also extremely fast and reliable, capable of rendering a site with thousands of pages in milliseconds.

Trigo is custom made and built with a mindset focused on having a minimal footprint. To get started, no extra dependencies are required; all you need is a single YAML configuration file, along with your Markdown content. Focus is on writing quality content instead of setting up tooling.
