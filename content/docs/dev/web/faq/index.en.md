## Override theme template

By Hugo's Lookup Order, you can override any part of a theme that you want. The following is a quick example.

Let's say you wish the `list` was different. All you have to do is copy the `list` template:

```shell
your-site/themes/Trigo/layouts/_defaults/list.html
```

And paste it under your own `layouts` folder:

```shell
your-site/layouts/_defaults/list.html
```

Then you're free to make any changes you want to the `list`.
When Hugo builds your site, your copy of `list.html` will be used instead of the theme's `list.html`.

We'll be using `yaml` format for all examples down below, as it is easier to read.


## Enable SEO

These include OpenGraph and Schema.

```yml
params:
  env: production
```

or set `HUGO_ENV` as "production" in system env-vars


## Failed to find a valid digest in the "integrity" attribute for resource ... ?

Read about How Subresource Integrity helps: [Subresource_Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)

Why was the `asset` not loading ? : [How_browsers_handle_Subresource_Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity#how_browsers_handle_subresource_integrity)

**Solution:**

Set the following in `config.yml`

```yml
params:
  assets:
    disableFingerprinting: true
```

## Add menu to site

You can add menu entries which will appear in the header of every page.

To do so, add a `menu` section to your site's `config.yml`:

```yml
menu:
  main:
    - identifier: categories
      name: categories
      url: /categories/
      weight: 10
    - identifier: tags
      name: tags
      url: /tags/
      weight: 20
    - identifier: example
      name: example.org
      url: https://example.org
      weight: 30
```

`name` controls what will be displayed for the menu entry.
`url` sets the URL that the entry points to.
`weight` is used to control the positioning of entries.

For more information on menus, see the [Hugo wiki page](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/).


## Pin a Post

Post can be pinned/ displayed top on the list by adding a `weight=<num>` var to page-variables

example:

```yml
---
title: "My Important post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
weight: 1
---
```

```yml
---
title: "My 2nd Important post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
weight: 2
---
```


## Adding Custom Favicon(s)

We support the following paths under `/static` directory
and can be added accordingly.

- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon-16x16.webp`
- `favicon-32x32.webp`
- `apple-touch-icon.webp`
- `safari-pinned-tab.svg`


## Centering image in markdown

Add `#center` after image to center align an image

```md
![name](path/to/image.webp#center)
```


## Using Hugo's Syntax highlighter "chroma"

Set hugo's markdown styling in site `config.yml`

```yml
markup:
  highlight:
    noClasses: false
```

`noClasses` has to be `false` to make highlight color follows the theme.
