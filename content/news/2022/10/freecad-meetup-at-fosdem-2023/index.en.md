Topics will include the status of the 0.21 (or is it 1.0?) development branch, the status of the ongoing merge of the Topological Naming Problem development branch, and much more. We encourage anyone interested in participating in the development of FreeCAD (whether as a developer, beta tester, bug reporter, or idea generator) to join us at the meetup. Follow the planning process on [GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA/issues/22) and the [FreeCAD Forums](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=71859).
