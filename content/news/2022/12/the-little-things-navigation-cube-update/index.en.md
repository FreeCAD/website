One of the elements that nearly everyone who uses FreeCAD has on their screen when working in 3D is the Navigation Cube. It provides a simple way of visualizing your orientation in 3D space, and serves as a simple way to navigate to predefined views ("Front", "Top", _et cetera_). A few weeks ago developer "adrianinsaval" (Adrián Insaurralde Avalos) submitted [an improvement to the Navigation ](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7876)[Cube](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7876) that makes the corners much easier hit-targets, so it's now easier to switch to isometric views of your model without going to the menus. Adrián was assisted in this venture by "Rexbas", "Jolbas" and "donovaly" (Uwe Stöhr), so if you appreciate the new, easier-to-use navigation cube, send your thanks their way.

You can find the feature in the [latest development builds](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle/releases/tag/weekly-builds) of FreeCAD: it will be included in the next full (non-maintenance) release.
