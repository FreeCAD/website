This past week marked the merge of a feature that's been in development since October: the ability to apply a tangency constraint to a line segment at B-spline knot points. In addition, the B-Spline knots themselves can now be constrained as any other point in Sketcher.

Developer **[Ajinkya Dahale](https://github.com/AjinkyaDahale)** has been working to develop this new feature as part of the [B-Spline Constraint Project](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=71130). Many thanks to Ajinkya, as well as to Sketcher Lead Maintainer [**Abdullah Tahiri**](https://github.com/abdullahtahiriyo), for their hard work on this project.

The B-Spline Constraint Project is funded in part by the FreeCAD Project Association Development Fund (FPADF).
