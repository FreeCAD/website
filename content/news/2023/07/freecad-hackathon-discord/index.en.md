The [FreeCAD Hackathon 2023](https://blog.freecad.org/2023/05/24/freecad-hackathon-11-13-august-2023/) is only a few weeks away. The in-person event is in Vancouver, BC, and the major nexus of the virtual component will be in the [FreeCAD Discord](https://discord.gg/w2cTKGzccC). We've created a [new channel](https://discord.gg/umhm9AnGJc) to begin coordinating what's going to happen at the event, and that channel will be the main communication channel during the Hackathon itself. If you plan on attending, either in-person or virtually, please join the discussion there.

Major topics of discussion during the Hackathon will be:

- Roadmap to the 1.0 release

- Default assembly workbench

- User interface cleanup, unification, and polish

- Translations

- Whatever else you bring to the discussion! Post on the Discord to get the ball rolling.

The exact agenda will be decided on-the-fly by attendees, and we expect there to be multiple simultaneous projects ongoing most of the time. The Discord channel has several threads in it to facilitate that effort, and more will be created as needed. I hope I see you there!
