FreeCAD is in a "feature freeze" as developers prepare for the 0.21 release. For those of you running development versions of FreeCAD, please help us test! If you think you've got a bug, please search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues) to see if it's a new one, and if so, help us out by writing it up.

Some remaining issues that must be cleared up before we release 0.21:

- The splashscreen must be selected ([vote here](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=685669#p685669))

- The remaining Toponaming Stage 2 cards must be completed

- TopoNaming Phase 2 (card 2 of 5) - [create ElementMap.cpp (and more to ElementMap.h)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/9115)
