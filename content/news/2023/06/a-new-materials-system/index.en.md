Last week [Alexandre Prokoudine](https://github.com/prokoudine) and [Dave Carter](https://github.com/davesrocketshop) published an article at the [Ondsel Blog](https://ondsel.com/blog) called "[FreeCAD Needs A Better Materials System](https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/)" -- we at the FPA couldn't agree more! The article gives a great overview of the current state of the materials system in FreeCAD, and the things that a new materials system needs to address.

Further, we'd love to see developers applying for FPA funding to work on this project. The entire purpose of the FPA is to help FreeCAD development, and this is a great opportunity for some developers to get paid for working on the software.

If you are interested in working on this project, please reach out to a member of the FPA for more information about applying for funding.
