On the weekend of 11-13 August, 2023, the FPA is hosting the [first ever FreeCAD Hackathon](https://blog.freecad.org/2023/05/24/freecad-hackathon-11-13-august-2023/). The in-person event is being held at [The Garden Strathcona](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Garden+Strathcona/@49.280944,-123.0882035,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x5486717710f193e1:0xcb1f27ee3a5c6db0!8m2!3d49.280944!4d-123.0856286!16s%2Fg%2F11f9gzznp9?entry=ttu) in Vancouver, BC, and we hope to be joined by many virtual attendees across the world helping us work on a few specific FreeCAD projects. But not only do we need your attendance at the event to make it a success (whether in-person or virtually), but we also need your ideas for what the top projects are that could benefit from the focused efforts of a team of developers all working synchronously.

For example, my hope is to focus on resolving Translation-related issues, because having a bunch of people around who are familiar with different areas of FreeCAD will allow us to resolve linguistic difficulties very quickly. We can cycle code updates and translation updates several times per day while we are all working together on it.

What ideas do you have for projects that you'd like to work on personally during this hackathon? What do you think would benefit from a few days of focused effort from a group of developers who are all working with very low latency? Let us know in the [Forums Discussion](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=683950#p683950), or any of the other myriad social media platforms that FreeCAD developers frequent.

Finally, if you are interested in attending in-person, travel grants are available. Please reach out to the FPA at fpa@freecad.org for information on how to apply. We're looking forward to working with everyone at the event!
