Spotted online, FreeCAD user [Erika Heidi](https://twitter.com/erikaheidi/status/1719071492791521344) was keen to explore sketching on round surfaces using the [Curves WB](https://wiki.freecad.org/Curves_Workbench). As a fan of Star Wars her learning project leaned into the idea of a desktop death star as a small desktop organiser box. It's a lovely object and a great example of sketching onto near spherical objects.

Erika says;

"_I have been using FreeCAD for a couple years but only recently I started doing more things with it, partially I got motivated by the contests and community at [http://Printables.com](https://t.co/yVaqLNuz2f). So I started experimenting with more complex things, and it's being quite fun_"

If you haven't come across the Curves workbench before it's available via the addon manager and contains a broad selection of tools for working with NURBS curves and surfaces. It's well described over on the [FreeCAD documentation ](https://wiki.freecad.org/Curves_Workbench)and there are numerous links to tutorials on how to use the Curves WB tools. Erika worked through [these example techniques describing the use of the SketchOnSurface](https://wiki.freecad.org/Curves_SketchOnSurface) tool to map her complex sketch design onto the spherical surface.

If you are inspired to check out the Curve WB tools then there is also a huge thread full of information on this brilliant and useful workbench over on the [FreeCAD community forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=22675).

 Erika has published the .3mf file over on the [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/631721-not-a-moon-container-organizer) site and has included some good advice on approaches to 3D printing this slightly tricky to print object. Huge thanks to Erika for letting us share her brilliant work.
