This past week saw the epic grid system merge in Sketcher, plus many other smaller projects (by my count this was the largest number of FreeCAD pull requests _ever_ merged in a single week!). In the coming week:

- The FreeCAD User's Conference is March 1-3, online. [Register here](https://hopin.com/events/freecad-and-free-cae-users-conference/registration).

- @yorik has a lot of irons in the fire this week: A new start page tab that helps you to choose which WB to use, a NativeIFC doc observer to handle document save/load, per-document Draft working plane & grid, and exploring markdown-based wiki systems.

- I (@chennes) am refining the upcoming job posting from the FPA for a developer to work on the "FreeCAD Component Library," and plugging away at making more of the Addon Manager's tests runnable outside of FreeCAD.

**PR stats:** In the week from Tuesday, 21 Feb to Tuesday, 28 Feb there were 103 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +15,626 / ‑10,734 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +151/ ‑70.
