[The FreeCAD Project Association](https://fpa.freecad.org/) (FPA)'s Mission is to support and protect the FreeCAD project. As an organization independent of the community FreeCAD project, the FPA would like to have a logo that is visually distinct. To that end, last month [we held open submissions for a new logo](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76211). Over the last week, FPA members have been voting for their favorites, and we have it narrowed to five final candidates.

Now, the FreeCAD Forums community at large will choose the final logo. Once chosen, the FPA will work with the logo's designer to finalize its details (tagline, colors, font, etc.). The designer of the chosen logo will receive a $100 US honorarium as thanks for their work.

To see the finalists, and to vote for your favorites, [head over to the FreeCAD Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=671401#p671401).
