Since its inception, FreeCAD's build and release process has been an entirely volunteer effort. As the project has grown, however, this has resulted in ever more work for the volunteers. Maintaining the various builds and releases is a mostly invisible, thankless process; but also one that is mission-critical. The FreeCAD Project Association is pleased to announce that we have contracted with long-time FreeCAD developer Adrián Insaurralde (@adrianinsaval) to maintain FreeCAD's build and release infrastructure. Adrián will be the main point of contact for all official builds and releases for the next year.

> I'm very excited to be officially working for the project, this grant will allow me to dedicate a lot more time into the project and will let us get releases out smoothly through multiple channels and respond to user problems more efficiently. The future of FreeCAD is bright and I'll be supporting it's distribution to the best of my abilities.
