This is a small announcement for who is using Git to work with the FreeCAD source code. More and more of the Git world is switching to the new convention to use "main" as their main branch name, instead of "master". We think it's a good time for FreeCAD to rename its main branch too.

The change will occur on **Sunday, October 8th, 2023 around 20h00 UTC**. If you are using a Git client, you will need to rename your local main branch as well, and reconnect it to the correct remote branch. Read more about that on https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=81651

If you don't use Git, nothing will change for you!
