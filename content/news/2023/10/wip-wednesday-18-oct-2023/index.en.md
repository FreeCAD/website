This week in FreeCAD development:

- **@yorik** merged the Help Module into main so that an external mod is no longer required to view the new Help system.

- @**[kadet1090](https://github.com/kadet1090)** modified the preference pack code to find the new Overlay stylesheets, and **[MisterMakerNL](https://github.com/MisterMakerNL)** made some Overlay changes to the included stylesheets and preference packs

- **@Paddle** has the new Assembly workbench to a point where it can actually solve some types of assemblies using the new solver. The next step is to add that solver as a submodule to the main FreeCAD repo.

- I (**@chennes**) split off some work to get Qt6 working on Windows under MSVC into its own PR, enabling compilation with the `/fpermissive-` flag.
