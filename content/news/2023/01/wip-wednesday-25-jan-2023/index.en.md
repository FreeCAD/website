Lots of interesting development happening this week as everyone gets ready for [FreeCAD Day 2023](https://blog.freecad.org/2023/01/04/freecad-meeting-day-2023/) in Brussels next week.

- @sliptonic announced the [launch of a new company, Ondsel](https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/), focused on cloud deployment and collaboration using FreeCAD.

- @abdullah is working on a new concept for a "[non-instrusive notification center](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=651344#p651344)."

- @wandererfan is working on the (oh-so-thrilling)  "FPA Financial Reports for 2022", and also doing a bit of development work on cosmetic geometry enhancements.

- @openBrain continues work on the continuous integration system on GitHub, and his PR is nearly ready for merge. He continues to work on several related projects.

- @mlampert is looking into using the [Cavalier Contours library](https://github.com/jbuckmccready/cavalier_contours) for Path operations.
