In very exciting Sketcher news, Ajinkya Dahale's (@jnxd) work on a the new [point-on-spline constraint](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7782) was merged late last week and is now available the main development trunk: it will be available in the next weekly development builds as they become available over the next several days.

This B-Spline project has been many months in the making, and is thanks to the hard work and persistence not just of Ajinkya, but also Sketcher Maintainer @abdullah and many other alpha-testers on the FreeCAD Forums. Thanks to all the developers and testers who made this excellent addition possible.

Give it a spin and let us know what you think: [FreeCAD Forums discussion is here.](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=71130)
