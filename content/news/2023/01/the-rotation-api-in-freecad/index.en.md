Much of FreeCAD scripting consists of creating objects and then placing them somewhere in 3D. For instance, we can create a default cube with

```py
doc = App.ActiveDocument
cube = doc.addObject("Part::Box","Box")
doc.recompute()
```

The resulting cube has its origin at (0, 0, 0) and is in its default orientation. To locate it elsewhere, without other modification, we can change its `Placement` property. `Placement` has two sub-properties: `Placement.Base` and `Placement.Rotation`. `Placement.Base` is the location of the cube's origin and `Placement.Rotation` rotates the cube (with its origin fixed) into its orientation. If we examine the cube's current Placement in the Data panel, we see

![Ewproperty Placement](EWPropertyPlacement.png)

indicating an "identity" Placement. The Position (Base) is (0, 0, 0) and the Rotation is 0^0^ around the z (0,0,1) axis. If now, for example, we change the cube's Placement with

```py
cube.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector (10, 0, 0), App.Rotation(App.Vector(0, 0, 1), 20))
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
```

this rotates the cube 20 degrees about its (0,0,1) axis and then translates it so its origin lies at (10, 0, 0), which we see reflected in the Data window.

##### Rotation(Axis, Angle)

Of the various ways of constructing rotations, perhaps the simplest to understand is

```py
rot = App.Rotation(Axis, Angle)
```

where Axis, the axis of rotation, is an `App.Vector` and `Angle` is the angle in Degrees. The (non-zero!) length of the Axis vector has no effect on its direction, so axes `App.Vector(1, 1, 1)` and `App.Vector(2, 2, 2)` represent the same direction. The axis argument of `rot` is stored as the property `rot.RawAxis` The Raw Axis is normalized to unit length by FreeCAD and is available as the property `rot.Axis`.

We see that in order to specify a rotation there are three degrees of freedom - two for the normalized direction and one for the rotation angle. However, the axis/angle representation is not unique. `App.Rotation(App.Vector(0, 0, 1), 30)`, `App.Rotation(App.Vector(0, 0, -1), 330)` and `App.Rotation(App.Vector(0, 0, 1), -330)` all represent the same rotation. To test if two rotations are the same use `rot.isSame(rot1, tolerance)`.

##### App.Rotation(vec1, vec2)

This represents a rotation that takes the direction defined by `vec1` and rotates it into the direction `vec2`.

The axis of this rotation is normal to the plane defined by the two vectors and the angle is the angle between them.

```py
vec1 = App.Vector(0,0,1)
vec2 = App.Vector(1, 0, 1)
rot1 = App.Rotation(vec1, vec2)
rot2 = App.Rotation(vec1.cross(vec2), Radian = vec1.getAngle(vec2))
rot1.isSame(rot2, 1e-14) #=> True
```

The `rot1` form is more convenient than the equivalent, first principles, `rot2` calculation, which assumes familiarity withe vector cross-product operation. The `Radian` keyword is used because the default angle argument is `Degree`.

Below we show this rotation acting on an object from the front and top views.

###### Fig (1) The `App.Rotation(vec1, vec2)` rotation front view.

{{< video "rot2output.mp4" >}}

###### Fig (2) The `App.Rotation(vec1, vec2)` rotation top view.

When we specify the final direction `vec2` into which `vec1` is rotated, we have only constrained two degrees of freedom, those of the direction specified by `vec2`, yet a general rotation has three degrees of freedom. What happened to the third? Suppose after our `App.Rotation(vec1, vec2)` rotation, we then spun our object around the `vec2` axis. The resulting composite rotation would still have rotated `vec1` into `vec2`, but the axes perpendicular to `vec1` will end up in a different directions. This particular constructor therefore cannot create the most general possible rotation.

##### App.Rotation(vecx, vecy, vecz, string)

This is a more powerful constructor capable of creating arbitrary rotations.

A natural way to define a rotation is by its effect on the three coordinate directions. That is, provide as input arguments the three directions of the rotated x, y and z axes. However, since each direction vector has two degrees of freedom, this specification would provide six constraints on the three degrees of freedom a rotation possesses. First we note that only two directions need be specified because the third is derived from them by the right-hand rule. This still leaves one over-specification, which is resolved in the following manner.

```py
from FreeCAD import Vector as V
rot = App.Rotation(V(1,0,0), V(0,0,0), V(1,0,1), 'ZXY')
```

What does this represent? `string` is the priority order of the axes.

- Z is first: the Z-axis is rotated into the direction vecz: `V(1,0,1)`.  (Two degrees of freedom used.)

- X is second: the rotated X-axis is placed in the plane defined by the `vecx` and `vecz` arguments, orthogonal to `vecz`. That is, the **component** of `vecx` orthogonal to `vecz` defines the rotated X direction.  (Uses one more degree of freedom.)

- Y is third: the `vecy` argument is completely ignored. The new Y-axis is created forming an orthogonal triad with the new Z and X axes, constructed from the above by the right hand rule (in the direction Z x X, for those familiar with the vector cross-product).

Our example generates the same rotation illustrated in Figs. (1) and (2) above. Note how the (blue) z-axis and (red) x-axis in Fig. (1) change. The mapping from (xvec, yvec, zvec) to normalized direction vectors, in the second listed step above, is illustrated in Fig (3), the movie below.

###### Fig. (3) zvec and xvec inputs create the zdir xdir rotated normalized directions.

This rotation method forms the basis of the  [O-Z-X attachment mode](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/O-X-Y_type_attachment_modes) for an object in FreeCAD.

##### App.Rotation(yaw, pitch, roll)

This is described and illustrated in the [wiki](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Placement#Position_and_Yaw.2C_Pitch_and_Roll). Here a rotation is described as the composite of three successive rotations. First a yaw about the z-axis, then a pitch about the **rotated** y-axis, then a roll about the **rotated **x-axis. More explicitly, here a **rotated** axis means that the axis is not the initial coordinate axis, but the axis that results from the prior rotations acting on the coordinate axis. Thinking of rotations of a body, the successive rotation axes are fixed in the body, not in space.

##### Compounding rotations

The action of a Rotation (or a Placement) on a vector is often called multiplication. We can write

```py
rot*vector #or
rot.multVec(vector)
placement*vector #or placement.multVec(vector)
```

to compute the vector resulting from the transformation. For successive transformations, the '*' is much tidier.

```py
rot2 * rot1 * vector rot2.multVec(rot1.multVec(vector)) rot2.multiply(rot1).multVec(vector)
```

all compute the effect of first rotating `vector` by `rot1`, then rotating the result by `rot2`. The result of applying two rotations is itself a rotation, likewise that of applying two placements is a placement. So the compound rotation or placement is just

```py
rot_compound = rot2 * rot1
```

and

```py
placement_compound = placement2 * placement1
```

There are three important things to note:

- Both placements/rotations reference the `same` coordinate system.

- Unlike when multiplying numbers, the order matters! If you rotate an object around two different axes, you'll generally get a different result if you reverse the order of operations.

- The rotation `rot2*rot1` means first rot1, then rot2. Think of them as function applications to understand the order.

To illustrate the second point, let us consider two easily visualized rotations R and S and apply them in opposite orders.

```py
from FreeCAD import Vector as V
R = App.Rotation(V(1,0,0), 90)#90<sup>0</sup> around x
S = App.Rotation(V(0,0,1), 90)#90<sup>0</sup> around z
```

![Rotationorder 5](rotationorder-5.png)

In the top row of the figure, we perform the rotation S*R . We rotate 90^0^ around the coordinate x-axis, followed by 90^0^ around the coordinate z-axis and show the effect on a axis triad.

In the second row, we perform the rotation R*S and note that the result differs from that of S*R.

The third row illustrates another important property of rotations. First we do the S rotation (90^0^ around z), then we perform R'. R' is again defined as 90^0^ around x - BUT around the (already rotated) `body` x-axis, not the `coordinate` x-axis. This is as in the yaw-pitch-roll section above.

We see the result of R'*S is the same as S*R. This is in fact a general result that I will not attempt to prove here.

_To perform a series of rotations in body coordinates instead of fixed coordinates, reverse the order of multiplications._

As an example, we can construct a rotation with a yaw-pitch-roll of 20, 30, 40 degrees, respectively, by post-multiplying the individual rotations.

```py
from FreeCAD import Vector as V
yaw = App.Rotation(V(0,0,1), 20)
pitch = App.Rotation(V(0,1,0), 30)
roll = App.Rotation(V(1,0,0), 40)
ypr = yaw*pitch*roll
ypr_direct = App.Rotation(20,30,40)
ypr.isSame(ypr_direct, 1e-14)#=> True
```

##### Offset rotations

If we want to rotate an object about an axis that is offset from the origin, we use the three argument form of Placement:

```py
App.Placement(base, rotation, center)
```

This means

- Rotate by `rotation` about an axis through `center`

- Translate the result by `base`

As an exercise, how could we have done this from first principles?

- Translate by -`center`

- Rotate by `rotation`

- Translate back by `center`

- Translate by `base`

```py
#sample data
base = App.Vector(50,0,0)
axis = App.Vector(1, 1, 1)
angle = 45
center = App.Vector(0, 10, 0)
rotation = App.Rotation(axis, angle)
#compare
ZeroRot = App.Rotation()
ZeroVec = App.Vector()
tr1 = App.Placement(-center, ZeroRot)
rot = App.Placement(ZeroVec, rotation)
tr2 = App.Placement(center, ZeroRot)
tr3 = App.Placement(base, ZeroRot)
offsetrot = tr3*tr2*rot*tr1
offsetrot_direct = App.Placement(base, rotation, center)
offsetrot.isSame(offsetrot_direct) #=> True
```

##### Inverse

Both rotations (`rot`) and placements (`pl`) have inverses, <code>rot<sup>-1</sup></code> and <code>pl<sup>-1</sup></code> which reverse their effect. These satisfy

![Equationsinverse](equationsinverse.png)

where `I` is the identity rotation or placement, respectively.

Recall from the compound placement section, we found that `R' * S = S * R`. We could use the algebra of rotations to compute `R'` explicitly. Multiply both sides of the equation on the right by <code>S<sup>-1</sup></code>, obtaining:

<code>R' * S * S-1</sup> = <em>R' </em> = S * R * S<sup>-1</sup></code> In code, this becomes:

```py
from FreeCAD import Vector as V
R = App.Rotation(V(1,0,0), 90)#90<sup>0</sup> around x
S = App.Rotation(V(0,0,1), 90)#90<sup>0</sup> around z
Rprime = S * R * S.inverted()
```

We find that Rprime is a 90^0^ rotation around the (coordinate!) y-axis, in accord with the composite rotation figure above.

```py
from math import degrees
degrees(Rprime.Angle) # => 90
Rprime.Axis # => App.Vector(0, 1, 0)
```

Being able to manipulate rotations (and placements) symbolically in this manner is a powerful tool. For another illustration of this, consider an assembly in which our object is contained in a sequence of nested container sub-assemblies.

![Nestedplacements 1](nestedplacements-1.png)

The global placement of the Cube is the product of the placements that contain it. Referring to the Placements of Part, Part001, Part002, Part003 and Cube as <code>pl<sub>0</sub>, pl<sub>1</sub>, pl<sub>2</sub>, pl<sub>3</sub></code> and <code>pl<sub>4</sub></code> respectively, the global placement of the Cube is <code>pl<sub>0</sub> * pl<sub>1</sub> * pl<sub>2</sub> * pl<sub>3</sub> * pl<sub>4</sub></code>. Suppose we want to change the global Placement of the cube to <code>gpl</code> by altering the placement of the Part001 sub-assembly, say by changing <code>pl<sub>1</sub></code> to <code>pl<sub>1</sub>'</code>. Then we know that

![Solveforplacement](solveforplacement.png)

solving for the unknown placement <code>pl<sub>1</sub>'</code> by pre- and post-multiplying by the appropriate inverses.
