_This guest post is by Varnu01. Editor's note: The User's Conference is an independent event and is not run by or affiliated with the FreeCAD Project Association, but we are happy to spread the word about opportunities for FreeCAD users to meet up and collaborate!_

Join the revolution of open-source software at the **first Annual FreeCAD (and free CAE) Users Conference**! From March 1st to 3rd, come together with a community of creators and users on the Hopin platform to share knowledge, network, and learn about the latest developments in the world of FreeCAD and CAE. You can click on the [registration link](https://hopin.com/events/freecad-and-free-cae-users-conference), [speaker list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11N1uI21M5MBU44JqO8Ex2s6uMxiLDujh/view?usp=share_link) and [schedule here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11NYdRz3KvgKyCVkVlSrcb1ndx7Tsj5H-/view?usp=share_link).

Conferences like this one play an important role in bringing together the community of users and developers to share knowledge, ideas, and experiences. It's a great opportunity to learn from experts in the field, network with like-minded individuals, and stay up to date on the latest developments in the world of open-source software.

The conference aims to bring the world of open-source software closer to the public and showcase the potential of FreeCAD and CAE through presentations, workshops, and interactive sessions. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn from experienced users and developers as they share their knowledge and experiences with the software.

This conference is part of a project titled: **Open Source CAD (and CAE) for Africa**, which is funded through the **UK's Royal Academy of Engineering**, _**Engineering X**: "Engineering Skills where They are Most Needed" Mission. _

It seeks to support the delivery of skills and education programmes that will lead to the development of much needed engineering skills capacity, enhanced safety standards, and infrastructure that will remain safe and fit for purpose.

Open-source software, such as FreeCAD, is changing the way we think about and use technology. Unlike commercial software, open-source software is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone. This allows for a more collaborative and inclusive approach to technology development, where contributions and ideas can come from anyone.

The emergence of AI and other technologies has also made it possible for open-source development to expand globally. Open-source software allows for faster and more efficient development of AI systems, as the community can collectively work on and improve the code. This is especially important in a world where AI is playing an increasingly larger role in our lives and society.

The conference will take place on Hopin, a virtual event platform that allows for live streaming, interactive sessions, and networking opportunities. It's the perfect platform for hosting a conference like this, as it allows attendees to fully participate and engage in the event from anywhere in the world.

Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and learn about the latest developments in the world of open-source software. [Register now](https://hopin.com/events/freecad-and-free-cae-users-conference) and join us on Hopin from March 1st to 3rd for the FreeCAD (and free CAE) Users Conference. See you there!

_"Together, let's embrace the power of open-source software and shape a more inclusive and innovative future."_
