The past week saw developers working on a large number of UI improvement projects, as well as quite a bit of behind-the-scenes code updating and cleanup.

- **@wwmayer** has been working on modernizing our C++ codebase, bringing various things up to the C++17 standard (which is our current target)

- **@obelisk** is homing in on an updated default color scheme that retains the feel of "classic" FreeCAD, but is better suited to vision-impaired users

- **@qewer33** has created an improved Start page that is in the PR approval queue now

- I (**@chennes**) am working on some translation issues, as well as fixing some issues with the 0.21 installers.

**PR stats:** In the week from Wednesday, 9 Aug to Wednesday, 16 Aug there were 52 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +6,680 / ‑5,960 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +128 / ‑115. We closed 43 Issues, and 21 new Issues were opened.
