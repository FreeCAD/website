The UI and code cleanup continued this week, but the real excitement is that work has begun on an integrated Assembly workbench.

- **@obelisk** has published a [proposed color palette](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=700988#p700988) that improves the contrast of the default theme throughout FreeCAD

- **@sliptonic** and the team at **Ondsel** are beginning their work on an [integrated Assembly workbench](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7/views/1?layout=board)

- **@wandererfan** is plowing through the backlog of PRs and Issues

- I (**@chennes**) am building a new LibPack with Qt6 and Python 3.11, and improving the process we use for creating new LibPacks

**PR stats:** In the week from Wednesday, 14 Aug to Wednesday, 23 Aug there were 65 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +10,275 / ‑48,812 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +161 / ‑762 (yeah, that -762 is a bit of an outlier!). We closed 24 Issues, and 26 new Issues were opened.
