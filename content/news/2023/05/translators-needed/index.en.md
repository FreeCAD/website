We [recently announced](https://wordpress.com/post/blog.freecad.org/868) that FreeCAD 0.21 would be released soon, and developers are now in the final stretch leading up to that release. We're hunting bugs, polishing new features, and generally making sure that version 0.21 is the best version of FreeCAD yet -- we anticipate it being most people's primary version while we work to integrate the Topological Naming Problem mitigation code, which is likely to result in some slowdowns and other miscellaneous issues.

One area of the code where you can contribute if you aren't a software developer, but are fluent in a language besides English, is translating the user interface. As of this writing we have three languages that are essentially complete: Belarusian, French, and Polish (though of course even those languages can use more reviewers), but we have many more that are very close to being complete, and we'd love to see those finished up and available in 0.21. So if you speak Basque, Croatian, Georgian, German, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, Slovenian, or Spanish, and you have a few minutes to help out, head over to the [FreeCAD CrowdIn page](https://crowdin.com/project/freecad), set up an account, and start suggesting translations. Of course, there are dozens of other languages that have partial translation support and we welcome your assistance on those as well, you just have a longer journey ahead of you!
