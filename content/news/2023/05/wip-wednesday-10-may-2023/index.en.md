Our first-ever full-developer-community meetup was this past Sunday, and we had excellent attendance. Thanks to everyone who joined us, and thanks to the folks at [Blender](https://developer.blender.org/), whose own meetups inspired the launch of ours. Over the past week we've squashed dozens of translation-related bugs, as well a several other things causing crashes or bad geometry. We are approaching a feature freeze in anticipation of our 0.21 release, which is coming soon.

In this upcoming week:

- Google Summer of Code developers have begun meeting with their community mentors, and are soliciting feedback from everyone in the community on their proposed work plans:

- [GSoC 2023: Unified Measurement Facility](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=78147)

    - [[GSoC 2023] On-machine Inspection](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=78215)

    - [[GSoC 2023] UI tool for fetching online content](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=680088#p680088)

    - [[GSoC2023] Upgrade the documentation system](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=680258#p680258)

- I (@chennes) am cleaning up some toponaming tests in anticipation of beginning the second TNP merge sequence.
