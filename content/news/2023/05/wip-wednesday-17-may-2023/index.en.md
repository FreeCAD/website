FreeCAD is now in a "feature freeze" as developers prepare for the 0.21 release. Everyone's focused on finding and squashing bugs for the next couple of weeks. Any pull requests that don't address bugs will be held until after the release has been completed. For those of you running development versions of FreeCAD, please help us test! If you think you've got a bug, please search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues) to see if it's a new one, and if so, help us out by writing it up. Thanks!

**PR stats:** In the week from Tuesday, 9 May to Tuesday, 16 May there were 37 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +5,794 / ‑1,785 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +157 / ‑48. We closed 24 Issues, and 20 new Issues were opened.
