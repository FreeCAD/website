We are just a few weeks from the release of FreeCAD 0.21, and we need your help to get across the finish line! Most critically, we need more folks to weigh in on [the "No Status" issues and PRs in the GitHub project for 0.21](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/4). If you're interested in helping with development, please take a look through this list and see if there's something you can help with, either by testing, verifying bugs, or even developing a fix. If you want to help with development and need help getting started, take a look at the [Developer's Handbook](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/). You can also ask for help on the [Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/w2cTKGzccC), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/freecad), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@FreeCAD), or any of the other social media sites linked to from our [Homepage](https://www.freecad.org).
