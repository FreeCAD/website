Since our editor-in-chief @chennes is away today, and we're lost without him, we have no WIP Wednesday! So let's have a look at the progresses towards the forthcoming 0.21 release. Things are going well and we are on track. The [0.21 project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/4) summarizes everything that needs to be done and where we stand. About 45% of the issues are fixed already, and another 15% is being addressed now. In the remaining 40% are many long-standing issues that might get reported to the next release if need be. But we are now all trying to process a maximum of it.

Among the most interesting issues fixed recently are a mountain of work on the sketcher by @abdullahtahiriyo, @wmayer and @AjinkyaDahale, a load of translation-related fixes by @chennes and @kaktus, and fixes all over the place by all the team. I can't mention everybody here otherwise we would not finish today, but [have a look yourself](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commits/master) at the frenetic activity.

There are also several other matters being addressed that are not strictly 0.21 goals but are related to it. The first part of the big [toponaming project](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/2), which has shaken the internet and made mothers cry, is almost fully merged into master. This first part is just the functionality needed for toponaming algorithms to work, and won't affect FreeCAD's performance. The rest will be for after the 0.21 release.

Like for release 0.20, we also organized a [splashscreen contest](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=78085). Today is the last day to submit entries, tomorrow voting begins. There is still time to add your idea!
