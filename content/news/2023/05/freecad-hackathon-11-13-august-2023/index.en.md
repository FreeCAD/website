The FreeCAD Project Association is sponsoring a FreeCAD Hackathon 11-13 August 2023. The in-person event will be held in Vancouver, BC, and we'll be live-streaming/live-blogging the event so that those who can't make it to the event can still participate. It's open to anyone who is interested in hacking on the FreeCAD source code (or working on translations, or developing an Addon, or creating themes, or really anything else FreeCAD-related). Financial support for travel expenses is available from the FPA: for information and to apply for funding, contact the FPA at [fpa@freecad.org](mailto:fpa@freecad.org).

Start making your plans now to attend either in-person or virtually, for some or all of the event. We'll be meeting in the upstairs event space at The Garden Strathcona, 868 E Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6A 1R6, Canada. I hope to meet some of you there!
