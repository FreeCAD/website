For many years FreeCAD has supported a linear gradient background: at long last, developer @**[xtemp09](https://github.com/xtemp09)** has answered the frequent call for a radial gradient. Coupled with @**[PaddleStroke](https://github.com/PaddleStroke)**'s rearrangement of the colors Preferences page, FreeCAD now sports an overhauled background option that is sure to make many folks quite happy. Enjoy!
