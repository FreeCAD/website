One of the new initiatives we are undertaking is the creation of a [Developer's Handbook](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/). It contains sections about the [Roadmap](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/), outlining the broad objectives of the project, a [Design Guide](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/designguide) to give developers advice about GUI design and consistency, and a [Maintainers Guide](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/maintainersguide/), detailing what, exactly, Maintainers are supposed to be doing and how they should conduct code reviews, etc.

If you just followed those links you may have noticed a certain lack of detail, at least in some places. That's where _you_ come in! We've just started this project. It's [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/DevelopersHandbook), and we are very much open to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/FreeCAD/DevelopersHandbook/pulls), helping us refine the various sections. Of course the entire document is a work-in-progress, and to a certain extent always will be. But there are plenty of areas to contribute to. You are also welcome to [file Issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/DevelopersHandbook/issues) on GitHub if you have ideas for changes but aren't ready to do any writing yet, or if you think something is unclear, or if you disagree with something the Handbook says.
