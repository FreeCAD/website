The past week saw a lot of refactoring and developer-oriented work (including the activation of pre-commit hooks that we expect will begin the process of unifying our disparate code formatting styles, and a new CI workflow running on Windows 11).

In this upcoming week:

- @[benj5378](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commits?author=benj5378) reports: "Making @wandererfan hard sweat reviewing my refactoring code. Not stopping before TechDraw module consists of 1 line of code."

- @[PaddleStroke](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+author%3APaddleStroke) is reworking the UI of image plane taskbox.

- @[yorikvanhavre](https://github.com/yorikvanhavre) is spending all his time tracking down memory leaks.

- I (@chennes) am still working on Toponaming code, developing unit tests for the StringHasher class.

**PR stats:** In the week from Tuesday, 4 Apr to Tuesday, 11 Apr there were 39 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +5,153 / ‑4,610 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +132 / ‑118.
