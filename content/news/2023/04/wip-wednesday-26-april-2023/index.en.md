In the past week we continued merging translation fixes, plus a significant visual cleanup of the Navigation Cube.

In this upcoming week:

- @yorik is busy killing NativeIFC issues and attacking Draft per-view working planes.

- @jonasb is working on the doc-strings of Sketcher's Python-API, i.e. the various <UserDocu> in the "src/Mod/Sketcher/App/*Py.xml" files.

- @wandererfan is working in issue #9365: accented characters, investigating a complaint about spreadsheet fields not working, and doing v0.21 release prep.

- @Kunda1 is doing triage and packaging.

- @jnxd is working on general tangency and investigating requirements for a unified user property feature.

- I (@chennes) am working in getting an Apple signing key for FreeCAD.

**PR stats:** In the week from Tuesday, 18 Apr to Tuesday, 25 Apr there were 55 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +19,551 / ‑10,610 lines (not counting translation changes, but counting some automated reformatting). That's an average merged PR size of +355 / ‑192.
