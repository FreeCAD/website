In the past week we merged quite a few minor translation fixes, as well as a new layout for several Preferences pages, and we feel like we've finally squashed a five-year-old "massive" memory leak report in Draft.

In this upcoming week:

- @[realthunder](https://github.com/realthunder) is working on resolving a bug in StringHasher that came up during the Toponaming integration work this week.

- @[bernd](https://github.com/bernd) is playing with IFC format and NURBS.

- I (@chennes) am working on resolving bugs that have been reported in the [FreeCAD-translations](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-translations/issues) GitHub repository.

**PR stats:** In the week from Tuesday, 11 Apr to Tuesday, 18 Apr there were 45 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +3,760 / ‑2,142 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +84 / ‑48. Yay for double-digit averages 🎉!
