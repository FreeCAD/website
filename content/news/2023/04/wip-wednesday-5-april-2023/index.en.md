Last week a number of exciting things happened: first, @wwmayer finished porting TechDraw to Qt6, so we are almost ready to have end-users testing Qt6 builds of FreeCAD. Second, @xtemp09 implemented a radial gradient background that is sure so make some users very happy. In addition, @PaddleStroke has been working to refine several different preferences pages to improve their usability.

In this upcoming week:

- @wandererfan is doing the FPA month-end accounting, and working on dimension reference TNP phase2.

- @PaddleStroke continues work on refining the preferences pages, and may look into an improved user interface for placing and scaling images now that the Image workbench has been incorporated into the core of FreeCAD.

- @Pesc0 and @jnxd are looking at various pieces of Toponaming code, doing some refactoring and writing tests.

- I (@chennes) am also back to working on Toponaming code, developing unit tests for several of the core classes that store the element naming information.
