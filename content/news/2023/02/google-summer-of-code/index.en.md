We are very excited that FreeCAD has been [selected as a program for the 2023 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/freecad). While we've participated in partnership with other organizations in the past, this is the first time we've submitted an application directly ourselves. We received some great assistance from a number of folks at FOSDEM 2023, so a huge THANK YOU to everyone who has made this possible.

Of course, now the _real _work begins! If you, or anyone you know, is interested in participating in Google Summer of Code, take a look at our [project ideas page](https://wiki.freecad.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2023#Implementation_Ideas), and the [GSoC checklist on the wiki](https://wiki.freecad.org/GSoC_Checklist). Or maybe you are already an experienced FreeCAD user who has ideas of your own... reach out to us to discuss them, either on the FreeCAD Forum, Facebook, Mastodon, Twitter, Discord, carrier pigeon, or by contacting a potential mentor directly.

GSoC is about getting people involved and contributing to open source over the long-term. As such, we heavily weight our application selection process towards students that are interested in remaining involved in FreeCAD and open source software development long after GSoC has ended. GSoC is not a job. If you think this is just a summer job, then GSoC is probably not for you. It's only like a job in terms of planning your time commitment over the summer.

Additionally, submissions are graded based on perception of the submitter's abilities to complete the task within the program timeframe, general consensus on the technical approach being proposed, and overall interest in having such modifications made to FreeCAD. Particular notice is made of students that are responsive to questions and readily interactive in the IRC channel or on the forum. Communication is a great thing.

If this sounds like it's for you, consider applying -- applications are open 20 March to 4 April.
