The [FreeCAD Project Association (FPA)](https://fpa.freecad.org/)'s Mission is to support and protect the FreeCAD project. As an organization independent of the community FreeCAD project, the FPA would like to have a logo that is visually distinct. To that end, we've launched a contest on the [FreeCAD Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76211) to design our logo. We are hoping that not only will this contest yield a great-looking logo for the FPA, but it will serve as a trial run for this sort of development process. There are many things in FreeCAD, from its logo to the default background color, that might benefit from having a selection process in place where community members can both submit ideas and participate in the selection, and where no individual Maintainer has to make the decision to merge on their own.

Did I mention there are prizes? As part of the selection process, the designers of the logos that make it to the final vote will each receive a FreeCAD t-shirt, and the designer of the final logo will receive an honorarium of $100 US as a thank you for putting in the time to help us better distinguish the FPA from FreeCAD itself.
