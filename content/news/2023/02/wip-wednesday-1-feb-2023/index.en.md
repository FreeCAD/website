This week's edition of WIP Wednesday is coming to you live from Brussels, Belgium -- home of the world's best waffles, beer, and open-source software developers! It's [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2023/) week, so many developers from around the world are gathering in Brussels to join various hackathons, conference sessions, and of course, [FreeCAD Day 2023](https://blog.freecad.org/2023/01/04/freecad-meeting-day-2023/).

Here's what devs tell me they are working on this week:

- FreeCAD Day 2023 is this Friday in Brussels: many of us are meeting up that day to discuss various ongoing developments in FreeCAD, "Unconference"-style. Expect several blog posts covering the goings-on.

- I (@chennes) am beginning work on the server-side scripts for the Addon Manager's new remote caching strategy, aiming to reduce data and power consumption, and provide "Last Updated" information for addons.

- @0penBrain is looking into a bug in the unit tests for the Path workbench when compiled with GCC on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

- @wandererfan is investigating a report of hatch anomalies and is continuing cosmetic geometry/view coordinate changes.

**PR stats:** In the week from Monday, 23 Jan to Monday, 30 Jan there were 46 pull requests submitted and 33 merged, with a total codebase change of +4,745 / -4,429 lines (not counting translation changes). That's an average merged PR size of +144 / -134.
