This week in FreeCAD development:

- **@Roy-043** continued his work on the new 'get_param' function to help having all defaults in one place to avoid inconsistencies.

- **@kpemartin** added initial support for reading colors from DXF files.

- **@Syres916** and **@WandererFan** made small fixes and improvements in the TechDraw workbench. In particular, an underline can now be used instead of the small green squares to identify editable text in templates.

- **@FlachyJoe** added the arc-to-arc/circle distance constraint in Sketcher, and **@abdullahtahiriyo** extended it to arc/circle-to-arc/circle.

- **@paddle**'s pull request to add combined rotate / polar pattern tool to Sketcher was merged.
