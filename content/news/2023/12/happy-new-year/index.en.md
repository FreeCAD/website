Happy New Year to the FreeCAD community!

We wanted to take this opportunity to wish everyone a happy new year and best wishes for 2024. We'd particularly like to thank the wonderful developers contributing their time and code to FreeCAD, increasing the functionality and usefulness of the platform.

Massive thanks also go out to those documenting FreeCAD and helping others learn, either via the amazing amount of community tutorials and guides or those contributing to the official [FreeCAD documentation](https://wiki.freecad.org/Main_Page). Thanks are also given to those testing, responding and reporting on FreeCAD features and issues either in the repositories or via the [FreeCAD Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/). We'd also like to acknowledge and thank those individuals and organisations who have kindly sponsored FreeCAD via the [FreeCAD Project Association](https://fpa.freecad.org/).

Finally we want to thank all the users who continue to push the envelope of FreeCAD and inspire the community to build great things. We hope you all have a wonderful New Year and enjoy working with and developing FreeCAD in 2024.
