This week in FreeCAD development:

- **@abdullahtahiriyo** activated new icon for optional unified coincident constraint.

- **@FlachyJoe** fixed a display error with the point-to-line distance constraint.

- **@maxwxyz** did an icon overhaul for the Sketcher workbench to unify the appearance and adjusted cursor icons to match toolbar icons.

- **@WandererFan** merged several fixes for the TechDraw workbench.

- **@pavltom** implemented proper selection of subitems and refactored tree view updates in TechDraw.

**PR stats:** In the week from Wednesday, 20 Dec to Wednesday, 27 Dec there were 15 pull requests merged, with a total codebase change of +623 / -327 (not counting all icon changes). We had an average merged PR size of +48 / ‑25. 20 new pull requests were opened.

**Issue stats:** we closed 24 issues, and 13 new issues were opened. Overall, 1,099 issues are currently open.

The FreeCAD Project Association recently approved three new members:

- Stephen Hawes, CEO and founder of [Opulo](https://www.opulo.io/), creators of the LumenPnP desktop pick-and-place machine designed with FreeCAD;

- Paulo Kiefe, founder of [Stemfie](https://www.stemfie.org/), a free & open-source 3D-printable and open-sourced educational construction set;

- Shai Seger, lead developer of [Fasteners](https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_FastenersWB) and [Sheet Metal](https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal) workbenches.

Extending the general assembly to include founders of FreeCAD-powered businesses and educational projects, as well as developers of popular workbenches will hopefully bring new perspectives to the project.
