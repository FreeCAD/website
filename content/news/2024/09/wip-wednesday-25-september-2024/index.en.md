This week in FreeCAD development:

**Measurement**: hlorus and AIRCAP fixed several issues including one release blocker, and PaddleStroke fixed Quick Measure to work on bodies in assemblies correctly.

**Draft**: Roy_043 fixed a minor issue, and Syres916 improved the color activation and added an ability to change the size of the snap text (in code).

**Part Design**:

- FlachyJoe fixed several issues where the padding operation would fail in some scenarios when applied with _Up to Face_ and _Up to Shape_ options (that's another release blocker down).

- AIRCAP fixed additive loft for cases when the selected shape is not a vertex in the sketch.

- theosib fixed Part Design to no longer allow part planes and axes as options for Sweep and Loft.

**DXF**: kpemartin fixed two regressions related to the importing of layers and layer names, and increased the importing speed.
