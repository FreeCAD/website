We've just published builds of the first release candidate for FreeCAD 1.0. You can download them [here](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle/releases/tag/1.0rc1).

So far, we've enjoyed the contributions of users who are happy to be living on the edge with our weekly builds and reporting whatever bugs they run into. That really helped us make the proverbial edge less edgy.

The intention behind making release candidates is to give them into the hands of a different demographic - users who usually stay away from unstable software yet are happy enough to try very nearly complete software and report issues they come across.

We are currently down to just 7 release blockers, but we expect that the release candidates will bump that number up a tad, and that's a good thing. While we desperately want 1.0 out, delivering a really stable release is a big deal for us.

So please download the RC1, try it on a real project if you can, give it some really hard time if you must, and report any bugs you see to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues).

If you are a developer who is interested in contributing to the effort, come look at the list of reports, pick an issue that seems trivial to resolve, write a fix, and submit a pull request. We have weekly [merge meetings](https://www.freecad.org/events.php) on Mondays to go through the queue of currently open pull requests. You are welcome to join!
