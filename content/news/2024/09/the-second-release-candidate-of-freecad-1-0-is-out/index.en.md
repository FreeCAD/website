We've just released FreeCAD 1.0rc2, builds are already available for [downloading on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/1.0rc2). The update is coming with just bugfixes.

The number of issues blocking the final release has been circling around 6-8 for the past few weeks and only went as high as 13 after we released rc1. We are currently at just 8 blockers.

Unless there's a lot of issues that haven't been previously uncovered by everyone who already tested the program, we think we can manage to finish off the rest of the blockers in a couple of weeks. The important thing is to fix and close new reports faster than they appear.

We'd be really grateful for testing rc2 and reporting bugs you run into, especially the critical ones like crashes and regressions (e.g. things that used to work before and now don't work anymore).
