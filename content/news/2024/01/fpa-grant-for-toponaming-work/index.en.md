The FPA has just given two grants for work on the Toponaming merge to community members @bgbsww and @CalligaroV-the two are working together for the next two months to integrate @realthunder's Topological Naming Problem mitigation code into the main development branch of FreeCAD. Kudos to them on their selection, and we are all looking forward to their work!

If you are interested in helping the FPA support this kind of development, [consider a donation](https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php)! Alternately, if you have an idea for a development grant and would like to apply, send an email to [fpa@freecad.org](mailto:fpa@freecad.org) with your idea.
