Anyone notice that there's a LOT more happening in the FreeCAD ecosystem lately? We were finding it harder to keep up with all the meetings, events, and milestones so we consolidated everything into a master events calendar.
If you're curious about what's happening, you can find the [calendar](https://www.freecad.org/events.php) linked in the community menu of the [FreeCAD home page](https://freecad.org).
