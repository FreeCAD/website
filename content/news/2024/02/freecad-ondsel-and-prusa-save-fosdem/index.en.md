Whilst there was enough toilet paper, there was an issue in deploying it. We were approached at the FreeCAD/Ondsel, KiCad booth by a FOSDEM volunteer who was worried. The team only had one key that unlocked the toilet paper dispensers and they were struggling to keep the flow of paper steady. A crisis was emerging!

Quick as a flash Brad from [Ondsel](https://ondsel.com/) stepped up, whilst he didn't don a superhero cape, he quickly whipped out the calipers and fluidly made a fantastic model of the key. Barely missing a beat our bold hero uploaded the design to [Ondsel Lens](https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/Ondsel-Lens), the amazing add-on for project sharing and collaboration.

Our next mighty hero stepped into the story, Pavel from [Prusa 3D](https://www.prusa3d.com/) who were just one booth away. Some quick printing ensued on the fantastic [Prusa XL](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-xl-2/) and suddenly the toilets of FOSDEM were safe once more!

The keys were passed back to the team and the FOSDEM experience was back on track. Phew!

On a more serious note, we'll share more about FreeCAD at FOSDEM and the FreeCAD day in the coming weeks. In the mean time thank you to everyone who came and said hello at the FreeCAD stand and for all the interest and support at FOSDEM.
