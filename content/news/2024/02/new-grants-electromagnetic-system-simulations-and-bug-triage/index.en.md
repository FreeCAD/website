The FreeCAD Project Association issued two more grants.

**Mario Passaglia** is now working on bugfixing and electromagnetic system simulations using CalculiX in the FEM workbench. Expected new features will provide the resolution of:

1. Electrostatics problems through an analogy with the heat equation to derive the electrostatic potential and field, employing Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

2. Magnetostatics problems.

3. Electromagnetic problems involving the generation of electromagnetic fields due to time-dependent currents, in conjunction with the analysis of heat transfer resulting from induced currents in conductors.

Mario's project is expected to last 7 months. He has been awarded a grant of $4,000.

**Max Wilfinger** is working on bug triage: verifying and prioritizing bug reports, assigning contributors to tasks etc. This is a different kind of arrangement. His contract is for 1 year, with monthly payouts of $500.
