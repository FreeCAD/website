This weekend in Brussels lots of members of the FreeCAD community will be at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/), the amazing free event for all things opensource. If you are attending FOSDEM please come and spend some time at the FreeCAD stand which will be in the K Building. We have some excellent neighbours, [Pine64](https://pine64.org/) and [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/) and we hope that FreeCAD sponsors [Libre Space Foundation](https://libre.space/) should also have a presence in this space.
