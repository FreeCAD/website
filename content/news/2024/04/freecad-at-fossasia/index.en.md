Recently Hanoi was the location of [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/)'s latest feature event, the FOSSASIA Summit. Wonderfully 3 members of the FreeCAD community went along to crew a FreeCAD booth promoting our work and community. Ajinkya, Amulya and Harshita made the journey over to Vietnam from India, Amulya and Harshita taking time out from their schedules at Chandigarh University and Ajinkya travelling from Mumbai.

With the booth set up it saw a steady stream of visitors over the weekend. Ajinkya, Amulya and Harshita all report that the largest group of attendees tended to be undergraduate students. They also report that most attendees hadn't heard of FreeCAD before and the most mentioned CAD packages were AutoCAD and Tinkercad. Conversations around this showed that in that part of the world AutoCAD is still often taught in colleges and often AutoCAD is offered for free (as in beer) to undergraduates in the region.

Numerous academics and Professors visited the booth, with some pondering about the ubiquity of AutoCAD in the region and taking promotional materials to start conversations back in their departments. Ajinkya, Amulya and Harshita fed back that there were lots of general questions about FreeCAD like, "is it really free?" "can it do x,y z?" and "is it available on Linux, mac, windows?" and more. It's great to have these fundamental questions asked as they often motivate and enable people to feel that FreeCAD is worth looking at and exploring after the summit.

One great conversation at the booth was that FreeCAD use is high in Taiwan, especially centred around the development and creation of prosthesis. If anyone reading has links into that community we'd love to hear from them and feature their work. The image above isn't that project but rather a photo from the neighbouring booth showing work from[ Salvage Garden](https://salvage.garden/), an assistive technology makerspace from South East Asia.

Finally massive thanks to Ajinkya, Amulya and Harshita for taking the time out to represent FreeCAD so excellently at FOSSASIA. It's fantastic vital work you've done to promote FreeCAD and also hard work, on your feet and talking FreeCAD for multiple days!
