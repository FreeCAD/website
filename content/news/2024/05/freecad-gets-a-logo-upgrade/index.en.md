Just in time for upcoming FreeCAD 1.0, the project got a major logo refresh.

To get there, the design working group organized a [popularity contest](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=87074). Volunteers submitted 46 designs, over 1,500 community members voted for the TOP-5, then a team of maintainers voted for the winning entry among those five - the one submitted by syta.co (FreeCAD forum handle).

We thank everyone involved: the designers for submitting their artwork, the design working group for organizing the contest, the maintainers team for picking the winner, and the entire community for taking action.

The new logo will be finding its way to all branding elements soon enough. You should also expect some guidelines on using the new logo.
