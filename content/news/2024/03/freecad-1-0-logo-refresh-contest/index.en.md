With FreeCAD 1.0 on the horizon, it's time to refresh the official FreeCAD logo. At the request of the project maintainers, the intent here is to follow a similar approach to corporate logos and evolve/iterate the current FreeCAD symbol instead of completely reinventing the symbology of it.

Voting details will be reiterated upon start of a community poll, but a 'ranked choice' voting system shall be used. The top 5 submissions will be pushed to the FreeCAD maintainers team for review and final selection.

You can post your submission to [this thread of the forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=86342) until April 14. Only one submission per person will be accepted.
