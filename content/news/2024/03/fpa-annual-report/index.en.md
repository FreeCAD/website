The FreeCAD project association or, as we like to call it, the FPA, is the non-profit body behind the FreeCAD project. "Behind" is not exactly the right term here, because it was specially designed to be a tool for the FreeCAD community, not a governing body. The FPA is responsible for collecting and spending the money donated to FreeCAD, and to help it reach the people who need it.
