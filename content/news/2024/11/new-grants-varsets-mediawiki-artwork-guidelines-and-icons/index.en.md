The FPA General Assembly approved three new grant applications.

**Pieter Hijma** will work on improving the user experience of VarSets. The work will include guiding the discussion on the more complicated topics, adding new features that are requested from users, and improving on various small issues. The work is scheduled to be done between January and April 2025. Pieter was awarded EUR 8,000 for the work.

**Turan Furkan Topak** aka "Reqrefusion" will improve the documentation wiki. He will apply fixes for some of the existing issues, improve the search feature, implement responsive design, opening direct user registration after making our Mediwiki instance vandal-safe, improve the editor, set up the ebooks generations for offline use, and improve various other things. Reqrefusion was awarded USD 3,000 for the work.

**Joe Sardos** aka "Obelisk" will write new FreeCAD Art Guidelines along with providing replacement icons to follow the new guidelines. The current art guidelines are well thought-out and provide for reproducible style, however fall short of following current design trends for visual communication and rely heavily on bold and brash color combinations. The idea behind this prohect is to replace the guidelines, document them, work with the FreeCAD community across several platforms to find both style and form that have a general widespread acceptance, and replace them in their entirety. Total expected duration of the project is 3 months (or until complete). Joe was awarded USD 1,750 for the work.
