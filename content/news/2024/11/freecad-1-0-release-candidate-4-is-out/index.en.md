We've just released the fourth v1.0 release candidate, you can [download it on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle/releases/tag/1.0rc4). There was no official announcement of RC3 yesterday because we discovered a regression immediately after releasing the builds.

Currently, we are down to just one release blocker that is a macOS-specific UI issue. We'll wait another week to see if there are any new blockers preventing us from releasing the final version. If all goes well, we will release FreeCAD 1.0 sometime next week.
