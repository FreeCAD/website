Since the pull request merge meeting yesterday we are in feature freeze. Here are the general rules:

- All the open pull requests with new features that had been submitted prior to the start of the PR merge meeting _will be reviewed_ for inclusion in v1.0.

- All the pull requests with new features that were in draft status prior to the PR merge meeting _will not be reviewed_ for inclusion in v1.0.

- All the new pull requests with new features filed after the PR merge meeting will be reviewed _after v1.0_ is released.

- All the pull requests with bug fixes will be reviewed as usual.

On June 24, at the PR merge meeting that day, we are planning to enter the UI freeze. We will stop reviewing PRs with new features (submitted before June 3) and will only review and merge bug fixes.
