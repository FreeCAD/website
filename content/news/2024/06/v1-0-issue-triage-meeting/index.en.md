This coming Monday, 1 July 2024, immediately following the regular PR Review meeting, we are going to meet to discuss the outstanding issues in the GitHub tracker, and decide which ones to prioritize in the final push to the 1.0 release.

The meeting is open to anyone interested in attending: if you can't make it, feel free to comment on current open issues on GitHub if there are any bugs you feel are particularly important. Please note that we are in a feature freeze, so only bugs will be considered.

For a link to the Jitsi call, please see [the calendar](https://freecad.org/events.php).
