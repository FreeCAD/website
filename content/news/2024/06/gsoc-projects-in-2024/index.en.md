This year, we have two students working on FreeCAD as part of the annual Google Summer of Code program.

**Harshita Saraswat** is creating a command-line tool to manage and manipulate FreeCAD preferences from outside the FreeCAD application. This tool is intended to be used for installing and configuring FreeCAD with scripts. Harshita is mentored by Ajinkya Dahale and Pieter Hijma.

**Kairen Shen** is working on the implementation of a semi-analytical finite element method (SAFEM) for pavement infrastructure modeling. A prototype in Matlab has already been developed, so Kairen is rewriting the SAFEM in C++ and integrating it with FreeCAD. Kairen is mentored by Chris Hennes and Mario Passaglia.

Midterm evaluation this year starts on July 8, all work is supposed to be completed and submitted fore final evaluation by August 26. We hope both students have a great time hacking on FreeCAD!
