This week in FreeCAD development:

**Part and PartDesign**: the unsung hero this week was AIRCAP who single-handedly wrestled with a huge amount of bugs and came out on top:

- Fixed 7 bugs and regressions in the boolean operations code, alleviated another regression, and provided a workaround for yet another issue operations - all that in just one pull request.

- Added features to investigate and debug the effect of Tolerance on FreeCAD features - and the effect of FreeCAD features on tolerance.

- Disabled the tesselation limit in Part to prevent large parts from freezing FreeCAD.

**GUI/UX**: various fixes arrived from Rexbas, NewStorm, and hyarion.

Among other changes:

- Roy-043 further improved the fix for dragging and dropping layers in Draft.

- yorikvanhavre and Roy-043 fixed a couple of bugs in BIM.

- PaddleStroke fixed two regressions in the Assembly workbench.

- WandererFan fixed a bug in TechDraw to restore leader line style handling, i.e. setting the leader line to dash, dot, dash and dot.

- marioalexis84 contributed two fixes and improvements to meshing in FEM.

- davesrocketshop fixed a bug where inheriting the material from the parent object would fail in certain scenarios.

As usual, more fixes arrived from wwmayer, yorikvanhavre, PaddleStroke, Roy-043, and FlachyJoe. Additional fixes arrived from mwganson, cjmayo, adrianinsaval, and pieterhijma.

Last but not least, yorikvanhavre added a dedication of FreeCAD 1.0 to the late Brad "bgbsww" McLean to the About screen.
