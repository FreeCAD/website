We are sad to announce that last week, Bradley McLean passed away due to unforeseen health complications.

Brad joined the project a little less than a year ago. Like many contributors, he started with small patches here and there. Building on these early contributions, Brad worked his way up to tackle one of the most serious challenges in the history of the project: porting and revamping toponaming fixes developed by RealThunder.

He was a good soul, he left the world too soon, and we will miss him dearly.

Chris Hennes: "The best part of working with Brad is that he understood that an Open Source project is as much about people as it is about software. I worked with him nearly every day for the last year, and his compassion and understanding of the human aspect of the project was as valuable as his tremendous contributions of code".

Pesc0: "I truly admire the insane talent Brad had. He joined the project in a moment when we were stuck, and effortlessly picked right up as if he had been working on it since the beginning. He then carried most of the toponaming effort until completion, and we wouldn't be where we are today if it had not been for him. Most of all I enjoyed his light-hearted spirit and every conversation we had about any topic we were passionate about".

Brad Collette: "I had the chance to meet him at the FreeCAD 2024 North American Meetup in Springfield and found him to be a brilliant guy. More importantly, he was a truly decent human who I enjoyed getting to know. This is a huge loss for the community".
