The FPA recently approved three more grants:

**Jackson Oursland** will research various options for FreeCAD to get fast CI runners. Currently, we have free runners from GitHub, but they are relatively slow and concurrency-limited. So Jackson will look into three general options: paid runners on GitHub, self-hosted runners in the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCS, maybe others), and self-hosted runners on premise. Jackson was awarded $500 for the research.

**FlachyJoe** received an honorary grant of $1000 for working on bug fixes in this development cycle. Most recently he fixed a ton of bugs in Part Design, specifically in the Helix code.

**Oficine Robotica** received a grant of $500 for creating a teaser video to demonstrate new features in the upcoming v1.0 release. The video will be part of the press release.

If you are interested in improving FreeCAD one way or another, you can[ apply](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement) for an out-of-program grant any time.
