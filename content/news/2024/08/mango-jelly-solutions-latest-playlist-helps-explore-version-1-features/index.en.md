With version 1 of FreeCAD approaching it's excellent to see people picking up on the new and improved features and workflows via the weekly developmental 0.22 versions. It's also particularly excellent to see those who produce tutorial content beginning to use version 0.22 so that those who pick up FreeCAD version 1 will have some support.

If you have spent even a little time in any FreeCAD community area be it the [official forum](https://forum.freecad.org/), [twitter](https://x.com/FreeCADNews/status/1294348540580442113), [fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@FreeCAD), discord, facebook and more, you probably will have come across Mango Jelly Solutions. Mango Jelly Solutions create fantastic quality FreeCAD tutorials over on their youtube channel. As such Mango Jelly Solutions are one of the most often recommended resources for learning FreeCAD.

They've an astounding array of topics and subjects in their playlists, but recently have focused on a s[eries of tutorials for beginners based on the developmental weekly versions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuyJLVUNtc3UYXXfSglVpfWdX31F-e5S). This is an excellent resource not only for those that are totally new to FreeCAD but it's also worth looking through to spot newer features and workflows if you haven't tried the development versions and are working with the stable branch.
