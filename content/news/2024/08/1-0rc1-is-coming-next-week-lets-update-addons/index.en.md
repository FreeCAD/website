Thanks to the work of contributors we have made really good progress fixing blockers, we are down to just 14. That's why early next week we are planning to create a Git branch for the v1.0 release and issue the first release candidate.

Right now, we expect that there will be at least a couple of release candidates, with one or two weeks of development between each of them. This largely depends on how many blockers the community discovers and reports, and how fast we can fix those.

So for users who want to help us make an awesome, crash-free v1.0 release - get ready to test release candidates and report bugs. Any contributors interested to help us fix bugs - you are most welcome to join the fun!

We also ask addon developers to start checking whether your workbenches and macros continue working as expected in the upcoming release. If you run into issues, please contact us.

There will be a biweekly developers call on Jitsi this Sunday. Everyone is welcome to attend, you can find the information about it on the FPA's [Events](https://www.freecad.org/events.php) page.
