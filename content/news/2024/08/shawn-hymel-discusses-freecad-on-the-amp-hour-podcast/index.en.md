Shawn Hymel recently appeared on the excellent Amp Hour podcast discussing some changes in direction in his work. Shawn is currently moving from his role in developer relations at Edge Impulse back towards creating training and educative content and course.

We've spotted recently over on the [fediverse](https://masto.ai/@shawnhymel) that Shawn has been using FreeCAD a lot and in particular been working on a collection of designs to create a [customised lap desk ](https://masto.ai/@shawnhymel/112898875941361522)which holds various devices securely and comfortably for Shawn to unwind and game a little away from his work desk.

In the podcast Shawn discusses his usage of FreeCAD and his thoughts leading up to FreeCAD version 1. He is working on creating tutorial content for FreeCAD which will appear on[ Digikey](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBQazB0HUySNug4eRm-73hNyMcCRViRB). It's brilliant to see Shawn working with FreeCAD and also excellent that he gives props to other tutorial content creators like [Mango Jelly Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@MangoJellySolutions).

You can check out the Amp Hour episode with Shawn via the link below, the main discussion around FreeCAD begins at around 19 minutes, but the whole episode is an excellent listen.
