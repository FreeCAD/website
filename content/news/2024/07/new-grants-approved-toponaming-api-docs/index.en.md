The FreeCAD Project Association has just approved several more grants:

**Bradley McLean** will continue his work on the TNP migration. He will develop new code to address portions of [SubShapeBinder](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_SubShapeBinder) and Sketcher that vary from both the code base at the time of the original TNP branch and from the current LinkStage3 branch. When no bugs are present, he will refactor code in Part and PartDesign based on discoveries during the toponaming project. This is a time commitment project with 100 hours of work scheduled. Bradley was awarded $5000 for the entire project.

**Anurag Singh** will improve the FreeCAD API documentation. He will reorganize the existing documentation, enhance docstrings to ensure uniformity and thoroughness, enhance the documentation's visual appeal and usability, automate documentation's generation, and write a contributor guide with instructions for effective documentation. The project is expected to last approx. 5 months. Anurag was awarded $4000 for the entire project.

**Pieter Hijma** will improve C++ API Documentation. He will refine a documentation standard in collaboration with the community and Anurag Singh (the other API documentation grantee) and apply the standard to files in the `App` namespace. The project is expected to last 6 months. Pieter was awarded €8000 for the entire project.

**Aleksandr Prokudin** will serve as FreeCAD's blog maintainer for the next 12 months. He will continue publishing weekly recaps of development efforts and post additional project news. He was awarded a grant of €500 per month.

If you are interested in improving FreeCAD one way or another, you can[ apply](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement) for an out-of-program grant any time.
