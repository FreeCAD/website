This week in FreeCAD development:

**Toponaming**: bgbsww fixed a blocker bug in the toponaming code, refactored all element name pairs into clearer struct names, and contributed several patches transferring RealThunder's code to solve the save/restore errors with objects with element maps.

**Assembly**: PaddleStroke fixed two bugs in the new Bill of Materials tool and resolved a shortcut conflict between the Exploded View tool and multiple other global shortcuts.

**FEM**: marioalexis84 fixed several issues in the workbench and added support for exporting FEM mesh 1D elements to VTK and importing VTK files as FEM mesh.

**CAM**: sliptonic fixed several "red ink" issues (cryptic messages shown in the Report View console rather than human-readable messages in regular GUI.

**Part Design**: wwmayer took out two v1.0 blockers, and chennes improved more code for Qt6 compatibility.

**GUI**: Syres916 fixed a couple of minor issues, and MisterMakerNL updated the stylesheet and fixed a bug where buttons in the Start page wouldn't work with an overlay.

**Measure**: Syres916 fixed a blocker bug, and hlorus fixed an issue where trying to measure distance or angle between two bodies in an assembly would provide an incorrect result.

Among other changes:

- WandererFan fixed an issue in TechDraw where the initial point of a leader added to a rotated view was misplaced.
