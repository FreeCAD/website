The FreeCAD project association has filled three [previously announced](https://blog.freecad.org/2025/01/24/job-openings-at-the-fpa/) developer-support roles:

- Pieter Hijma will take the role of OpenCASCADE Liaison. He will coordinate bug reports and patches with the upstream development team.

- Sofia Fabiancic-Zühr will be the Translatable Text Reviewer. She will improve the consistence of terminology use throughout FreeCAD and improve grammar, spelling, and syntax.

- Ulices Avila Hernandez (a.k.a. @hasecilu) will be the Addon Ecosystem Coordinator. He will test addons and work with 3rd-party developers to ensure addons compatibility with the current stable version of FreeCAD.

All three roles come with a 1‑year long contract and a grant of up to $500 a month to support their efforts.
