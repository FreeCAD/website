The FPA General Assembly approved another grant application.

Ajinkya Dahale will continue refactoring Sketcher. The main deliverables are the same as the last time: more methods simplification, testing, and documentation. This will not direct affect features or usability, but it will help other developers contribute to the program.

On top of that, Ajinkya plans to spend more time merging his previous changes into the main development branch (he was holding those off due to v1.0 feature freeze), splitting 10K LOC long classes into smaller, more manageable ones, and helping others review pull requests.

For more technical information, please see the [grant application](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals/issues/23).

Ajinkya will receive a grant of EUR 4000 for the entire project.
