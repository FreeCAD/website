- tritao improved the Coin scene inspector dialog to make the information human-readable.

- PaddleStroke improved the stylesheet to get the correct background color displayed after moving a toolbar in the menubar and backported extended branding options from Ondsel's soft fork.

**Part and Part Design**: wwmayer improved several aspects of the new datum objects; he renamed the user-visible menu items and added methods to get the base and direction of datum elements.
