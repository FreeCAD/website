This week in FreeCAD development:

**CAM**:

- phaseloop migrated the Array operation to a dressup operation and changed the design of the origin axis to be in line with the LCS indicator.

- bdieterm contributed a minor fix.

**TechDraw**: benj5378 fixed a bug where edges would have the wrong color, and jonzirk76 contributed minor code refactoring.

**Surface**: Shkolik changed the behavior of the Fill Boundary Curves and Sections surface tools: after activating either of the tools, there's no need to click on the "Add edge" button anymore, you can select edges immediately.

**Addon Manager**: chennes moved the code to its own repository and made it a Git submodule. According to chennes, this will ultimately provide the ability for the Addon Manager to update itself even within individual releases of FreeCAD.

**GUI**:

- alfrix fixed the Quantity spinbox margin so that on-view input widgets would render correctly in Sketcher.

- kadet1090 added an optional origin placement indicator in the LCS indicator style.

- vletii fixed the behavior of the Freeze toggle to unfreeze objects down the hierarchy properly.

- pieterhijma patched varsets to make value inputs show units for properties that have units.

Among other changes:

- Fixes in Draft by Roy_043, aprospero, and luzpaz.

- Further work on XML bindings refactoring in Sketcher and Part by tritao.

- Fixes in PartDesign by PaddleStroke.
