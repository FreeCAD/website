The FreeCAD Project Association has awarded a grant of EURO 5,000 to the CAD Working Group (CWG) for allocation towards bounty projects.

Most of the deliverables are TechDraw improvements, such as adding support for labeling symbols from ISO 129-1:2022 and workpiece edge symbols from ISO 13715, adding broken-out section views to the Complex Section tool, etc. You can find the full list of deliverables in the [grant application](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals/issues/37).

The CWG formed itself last year to complement the Design Working Group. It's composed of volunteers from the FreeCAD community who are professional CAD users. The role of the working group is to provide input from professional CAD users with both mechanical engineering and architectural backgrounds.

The working group's goal moving forward is to propose new features to follow industrial practice, find issues with existing features, and give advice to contributors wanting to solve issues or implement new features.
