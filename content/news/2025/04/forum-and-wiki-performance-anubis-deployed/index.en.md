For some time the [FreeCAD Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/) and the [FreeCAD Wiki](https://wiki.freecad.org/Main_Page) have had performance issues resulting in some frustration as they have been periodically hard to access. The root cause of this stemming from automated AI Scrapers. A while back we asked if anyone had [any suggestions for mitigiating these issues ](https://blog.freecad.org/2025/01/30/freecad-forum-performance-issues/)and we thank those who reached out with ideas.

A little over 24 hours ago Kurt deployed [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/), a wonderful opensource tool that promises to "_Weigh the soul of incoming HTTP requests using proof-of-work to stop AI crawlers_". So far we are seeing excellent results which should result in more stability in access to those precious forum and wiki resources.
