This week in FreeCAD development:

**Sketcher**: Shkolik fixed a bug in Sketcher where it wouldn't be able to project a BSpline from another sketch.

**TechDraw**:

- WandererFan fixed several issues, including one where arrow style settings would overwrite existing dimension objects.

- benj5378 did more code refactoring.

**FEM**:

- marioalexis84 added a FRD format converter to VTK (the former is used in CalculiX to read results of previous calculations like displacements and stresses)

- PaddleStroke and colinRawlings contributed two small fixes.

**UI changes**:

- kadet1090 implemented three-point lighting (main, back, and fill lights); the viewport is now prettier than ever before. Following that change, maxwxyz removed his workaround to help see sketcher geometry in front of planar geometry normal to the camera.

- kadet1090 also implemented an option to show the placement (or origin) of the object: the center point, normal direction, and axes of the sketch.

- Rexbas fixed an issue where clicking navigation cube buttons too fast-before the current animation finishes-would result in incorrect view rotation.

- theepicviolin added SolidWorks navigation style.

- Zen-cronic added a right-click menu option "Open File Location/Reveal in Finder" in the Tree view for models.

- alfrix simplified the 'fx' icon for expressions to be more legible at small sizes.

**Among other changes**:

- Jonezzzzz and chennes fixed a couple of bugs in Sketcher.

- Roy_043 fixed two minor issues in Assembly and incorrect alignment of sketches in SVG and legacy DXF export in Draft.

- leoheck and furgo16 contributed several improvements to the Addon Manager's internal mechanics, in particular, for Snap builds.

- LarryWoestman backported some of his earlier CAM fixes and improvements to the v1.0 branch for future point releases.

- tritao introduced a new Python-based C++ bindings generator.

- adrianinsaval fixed a bug where spnav (Space Navigator support) would not be enabled by default on Linux.
