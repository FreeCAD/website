The FreeCAD Project Association (FPA) has just published the [2024 annual report](https://fpa.freecad.org/annualreports/2025.html).

Here are some of the report's highlights:

- FreeCAD 1.0 release as the major milestone for the entire community.

- TOP5 achievements: major progress with toponaming, integrated Assembly workbench, UX/UI improvements, new materials system, better documentation.

- Rapid activity growth in the grant program.

- Better development ecosystem: the FPA now funds the work of a bug triage manager, continues funding release management, and has better forum and community guidelines.

- Financials: EUR 186,000 in donations, EUR 99,000 in expenses.

The report also announces 2025 plans, such as increasing the spending and improving various aspects of the FPA's operation. We are also looking into better collaboration with educators around the world, particularly in the academia.
