The FreeCAD Project Association collects corporate and personal donations and distributes the funds to contributors who improve FreeCAD and its ecosystem.

In 2025, we are switching to quarterly waves of grant application reviews. Here are the submission deadlines:

- Q1: March 1

- Q2: June 1

- Q3: Sept 1

- Q4: Nov 15

If you want to apply for a grant for the next round of reviews, please [submit your application](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals) before March 1. Otherwise, your submission will be reviewed in the next wave.

For 2025, we earmarked $20,000 for each quarterly wave (a total of $80,000). Since we now commonly receive applications requesting $5,000 to $8,000 per project, we expect some competition between contenders. Please follow the [guidelines](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/process/grant-program-rules) when submitting your application.

While we don't have a fixed list of project ideas, we generally favor applications that address major issues preventing FreeCAD from gaining wider adoption. Expect higher priority given to projects that aim to improve UX/UI or performance, introduce missing functionality, and improve existing design features (such as fillets).

We also have a separate [Ondsel Onward fund](https://blog.freecad.org/2025/02/14/the-ondsel-onwards-fund/) of $40,000 for developers interested in making any code developed by Ondsel to become more useful for the FreeCAD community. This fund comes from a private sponsor.

If you are interested, please read the [development fund page](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement) and apply.
