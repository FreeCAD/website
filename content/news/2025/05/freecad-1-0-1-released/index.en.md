We've just released FreeCAD 1.0.1. There are no new features in this version. The [176 commits](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/compare/1.0.0...1.0.1) that we backported from the main development branch are fixes for various issues identified in the stable release. We encourage everyone using v1.0 to [upgrade](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php)!

There will be more minor releases with just the bugfixes this year. We'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has or continues to contribute to FreeCAD!
