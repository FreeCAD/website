The FreeCAD project got three students in this year's Google Summer of Code program.

Here are the projects:

1. chiragsingh1711 will enhance the TechDraw workbench to enable **3D PDF exporting**. Users will be able to create standard technical drawings with traditional orthographic views and dimensions, plus an interactive 3D view that appears as a regular isometric view in print but becomes fully interactive when viewed digitally.

Mentors: Pieter Hijma, reqrefusion, CADialog.

2. Sayantan Deb will add **interactive controls to the 3D view**, mostly for the PartDesign workbench. Think on-view parameters in Sketcher or transformation gizmos. This will allow users to perform the operations more easily with increased visual feedback. The controls will be configurable and won't interfere with the existing experience.

Mentors: Chris Hennes, reqrefusion, Kacper Donat.

3. theo-vt will work on **multiple files' parallel editing**. This project aims to remove the limitation where one document cannot be edited until an operation on another document is completed. This will make FreeCAD more powerful for advanced users, but also friendlier for beginners.

Mentors: reqrefusion, Kacper Donat.

All three projects will contribute to making FreeCAD more capable and user-friendly.
