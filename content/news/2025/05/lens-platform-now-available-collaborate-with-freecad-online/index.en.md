Earlier this year the FreeCAD Project Association (FPA) awarded a [grant that sought to make the Ondsel Lens platform available to all.](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals/issues/29) If you don't know the Lens platform it enables vault style storage of projects with a heap of online collaborative tools. You can use it as a platform to show off your projects and products, or as a way to assign team members and tasks and work collaboratively on FreeCAD projects. As part of Ondsel it was deployed via AWS and relied on lots of dependencies. The FPA grant has enabled Amritpal Singh, one of the original Lens developers, to work to get Lens self deploy-able and cloud agnostic, which it now is!

Over on [the repository](https://github.com/FreeCAD/Ondsel-Server/blob/main/README.md) there are some instructions to deploy this locally either using docker or full manual install. Within no time you can be up and running with your team!
