We have a great relationship with many opensource projects non more so than KiCad. As such we'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that this years [KiCon North America](https://kicon.kicad.org/na2025/) is taking place in a little over 14 days. This time it's in San Diego CA in the Qualcomm institute.

The final itinerary of talks is still to be released, but over on the[ fediverse](https://fosstodon.org/@FreeCAD) we've seen discussion that the excellent [KiConnect](https://git.oit.cloud/morgan/kiconnect) FreeCAD workbench is one of the many exciting things to be presented. Created by Morgan Allen, KiConnect is still in reasonably early development but promises to be fantastic. It's great to see such interesting interoperability develop between FreeCAD and KiCad as well as the already established [StepUp KiCad ](https://wiki.freecad.org/KicadStepUp_Workbench/it)workbench. Somehow, along the way the KiConnect project really highlights how innovative open source methodologies can be.

We'd like to wish the whole KiCAD community well for KiCon and we'll definitely feature KiConnect here on the blog soon. If you can't wait then a small teaser overview of KiConnect can be seen on [Gareth Halfacree's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ghalfacree) below.
