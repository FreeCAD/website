This year, we are running the grant program in four waves. The deadline for submissions in the second wave is quickly approaching. We will wrap up on June 1, so if you are considering participation and you have a great project in mind, please submit your application before that. Otherwise, it will be reviewed in the third wave.

For program rules and guidelines, please see [this page](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement).
